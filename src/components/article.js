                            <div className="art-txt">Summary: Touch typing is a "must have" skill in our digital world. After reading this article, you will know what is average typing speed for men and women, why it's important to overcome these results, and how it may help to make your life easier. Average Typing Speed: Why Is Is Important?
Any information on typing always comes down to the same question: What are your average typing speed and your accuracy? Why is it so important, and why does everyone want to know? Below are a few facts about typing and hopefully, a few hints as to why average typing speed is so important.

The Highest Typing Speed:
The fastest typist in world was a woman named Barbara Blackburn. In 2005, using a Simplified Dvorak keyboard, she was able to sustain 150 words per minute for 50 minutes, and 170 words per minute for shorter amounts of time. She was even clocked at a peak speed of 212 words per minute. This is well above what a professional typist, using a QWERTY keyboard, will usually manage. 50 to 80 words per minute is around the average for professional typists, and should be what most people strive for if they type for a living.

Average Typing Speed Statistics
As a general rule, girls like to type more than boys.
This may be for variety of reasons. Boys, stereotypically, spend more time on multi player online games that require quick typing speeds in order to communicate with your teammates. The divide is not as high as you would think though, as approximately 45% of boys prefer typing, to 55% of girls. This is a statistic related only to touch typing, as there are high number of female dominated jobs that require typing skills, though not all of them require a high word per minute speed.
Average one minute typing speed, for most casual typists, is around 41 words per minute, with approximately 92% accuracy.
To give this a bit of context, writing things by hand is usually around 31 words per minute for memorized material, or 22 words per minute for copied material. This is a good speed for someone who only types out the occasional email to family, or for someone whose livelihood doesn't depend on their speed at a keyboard. For anyone else, a regiment of practice should be employed to improve speed and accuracy.
When it comes to any skill, the most important thing to remember is to practice.
I'll say it again, just for retention: Practice. You wouldn't sit down at a piano and expect to be a concert level pianist, and you shouldn't sit down at a keyboard and expect to be a competition level typist either. Spend 30 minutes or so each day practicing. If you're just beginning, or working on switching over from hunt and peck style typing, then start from the beginning and work your way up. If you've already got some decent touch typing skills, then work on accuracy and speed drills. Keep track of your efforts over the course of a few weeks and you will see marked improvement.
With touch typing, it is important to start young. Studies have shown that for people ages 18 and younger, it is two times easier to learn to touch type properly. It's no different than learning a new language and multiple studies have proven that children learn and retain new languages much easier than adults do. Teaching children how to properly touch type may be the most important skill you can give them to help them gain success in the work place.So why is your average typing speed and typing accuracy so important? The fact of the matter is that typing skills are the most important thing to learn, at any age, to make you a more coveted employee.

Employers are more likely to hire an experienced touch typist than a hunt and peck typist, simply for efficiency. Do yourself a favor and learn the basics, if you don't already know them. You'll be surprised what a difference it makes. Test your typing speed in WPM here. After passing a test you will get a typing certificate that you may put in your resume.
You will be able to finish your typing work faster no matter you are a student, at work or at home working as a freelancer writer.</div>

                            <div className="art-txt">There are many reasons why keyboarding is preferred over the “Hunt-and-peck” method of using a computer. Touch typing enhances accuracy as you harness muscle memory in the fingers to assist with spelling. So what do we mean by muscle memory?

Once you have mastered the fingering on the keyboard, and consistently use the same finger for a letter, you automatically remember where the finger goes without conscious thought.

If you ask someone who’s been typing for years, “Where is the letter b?” or any other letter of your choice, they may have difficulty remembering because this is a skill they have internalized so well. The conscious brain will be slower at answering the question comparing to the finger.

Through sufficient repetition, the fingers reach automatically for individual keys when they are needed. You don’t have to consciously think about where the fingers go.

Touch typing makes you faster. This, in turn, means you will be more productive, as it takes you less time to do tasks so you can take on more work or assignments, or alternatively spend less time sitting at a computer. Automatizing the process improves the quality of your writing too. It frees up cognitive energy so you can focus on the ideas instead of just the language required to articulate them.

Moreover, learning keyboarding improves accuracy and can help with decoding and sight-reading skills for children and adults who struggle with specific learning difficulties. Learn more about the benefits.

Keyboarding at school
While tablets have become important tools in education today, typing on the computer is still a crucial skill for students to learn. Keyboarding means the muscles in the hand are involved in typing; the student feels his or her way through the activity instead of using the eyes as a guide.

Children will often benefit from studying keyboarding alongside learning how to read. That’s because in a multi-sensory course, such as Touch-type Read and Spell, the learning process reinforces phonics. Students hear a word spoken, see the word on the screen and then type it.

This helps them with the sound-letter mapping required for decoding and spelling. It also reinforces sight-reading skills through repetitive drills of high frequency vocabulary.

In later grades, school assignments become longer and it is often a requirement that written work is typed. Writing on the computer can actually improve a student’s skills because the process becomes more fluent as ideas flow freely through the fingertips and onto the screen.

Mistakes are easier to correct and re-write and working in drafts is more convenient. University students and researchers will benefit from taking electronic notes in class. Even adults who are returning to school can use touch typing to help develop spelling, literacy and computer skills. Last but not least, homework assignments, group work and sitting standardized exams are all facilitated.

In fact, computer testing is one reason why keyboarding should be considered an essential skill for all students to learn at school. The faster a student can type, the more time they can devote to improving the quality of their response and answering the rest of the exam’s questions.

Nonetheless, not all institutions offer it as a course. Learn more about why and how a school might introduce keyboarding. Learning difficulties
Individuals with dyspraxia, dysgraphia and other specific learning difficulties often struggle when it comes to writing by hand. Learning how to type can help these students achieve their full potential at school by reinforcing literacy skills.

It will also benefit people with visual impairments and other special needs too, including individuals with autism spectrum disorder and Down syndrome.
